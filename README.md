# dmv
Move duplicate files

I wrote this because I had a big folder (tens of gigabytes, hundreds of files) with some duplicates in it, and I wanted to pull the dupes out and put them somewhere else. It ran a lot faster than I expected it to, so I'm sharing it for others to use.

Use it like so:

python -m dup_check.py folder_to_scan folder_to_put_dupes

I plan to make it a little easier to use soon.
